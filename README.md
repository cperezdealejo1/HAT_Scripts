# HAT_Scripts
This repository contains Python scripts developed for various modules including the MCC134 Daqhat, a 105E-L thermocouple, the PiCamera NoIR module, the Pimoroni Growhat, and Enviroplus sensors. These scripts were specifically designed to meet my project requirements but can certainly be adapted to fit your own.

Please note that these scripts may not work out-of-the-box, as they depend on several libraries and packages that must be installed beforehand. Specifically, if you're facing issues like ImportError or ValueError related to the MCC134, ensure that the official MCC134 daqhat repository is installed on your system. Reinstall as needed.

In some instances, you might find the sensor is recognized by the Pi without any errors, but still fails to operate as expected. In my experience, if all troubleshooting has failed, wiping the Pi or using a different Pi might be the only solution. I've taken every measure to avoid this drastic step, but it was unavoidable in certain cases.

This code is by no means perfect - there's certainly room for enhancement and optimization. But it worked effectively within the scope of my project's requirements. I invite any suggestions or improvements. Feel free to adapt and modify the code to meet your specifications.

I hope these scripts will prove to be useful. Thanks.
