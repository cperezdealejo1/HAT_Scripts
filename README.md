# HAT_Scripts
Simple python code for the mcc134 Daqhat in conjunction with a 105E-L thermocouple, a picamera NoIR module, the Pimoroni Growhat and Enviroplus sensors. Please keep in mind that some of these 
codes do not work straight off the bat, and need to have the necessary dependencies installed from the offical publishers github.

For example, if you are having difficulty with the mcc134, giving error statements like ImportError or ValueError, etc, make sure you you have official mcc134 daqhat repository installed on your system, 
and reinstall as needed. 

Furthermore, sometimes I ran into an issue where the sensor was being recognized by the Pi, no errors and the like, however, it still didn't run as it was supposed to. I have found that the only solution
was to wipe the Pi or get a new Pi altogether. Please keep in mind that I tried every solution possible and I could not find a way to circumvent having to wipe the Pi. 

Also, This code and everything else was written by a complete amateur. It does, however, get the job done and complete the specifications perfectly, but I ill admit that the code can be 
streamlined further and made more organized. 

I hope that the code is satisfactory and manages to help with any problems that may arise. Thanks.
